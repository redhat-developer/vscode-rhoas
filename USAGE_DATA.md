# Data collection

`Red Hat OpenShift Application Services` has opt-in telemetry collection, provided by [`vscode-redhat-telemetry`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-redhat-telemetry).

## What's included in the `Red Hat OpenShift Application Services` telemetry data

 * A telemetry event is sent every time new Kafka clusters have been added to the Kafka explorer.
    - includes the number of added clusters
    - the error message if there was an error
 * A telemetry event is sent every time the "Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka" dashboard is opened, via the command palette or clicking on a button
    - includes the reason why it was opened
 * A telemetry event is sent a new "Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka" cluster is created. Data includes:
    - the cloud provider
    - the cloud region
    - multizone or not
    - the error message if there was an error

## What's included in the general telemetry data

Please see the
[`Red Hat Commons` data collection information](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-redhat-telemetry/blob/HEAD/USAGE_DATA.md#other-extensions)
for information on what data it collects.

## How to opt in or out

Use the `redhat.telemetry.enabled` setting in order to enable or disable telemetry collection.
Note that this extension abides by Visual Studio Code's telemetry level: if `telemetry.telemetryLevel` is set to off, then no telemetry events will be sent to Red Hat, even if `redhat.telemetry.enabled` is set to true. If `telemetry.telemetryLevel` is set to `error` or `crash`, only events containing an error or errors property will be sent to Red Hat.
